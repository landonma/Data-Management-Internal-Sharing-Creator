# Documentation File Template README
-------------------
This repository contains a template for to help you create an Internal Data Sharing Plan. An Internal Data Sharing Plan is designed so that researchers will make decisions about data sharing and data attribution before problems arise. This document makes sure everyone has the information they need to decide when and how to share data internally.   

## Instructions for Completing the Template
*Go [HERE](https://github.com/landonma/Data-Management-Templates-Project/blob/master/readme.md) for more detailed instructions*  
Download our [repository](https://github.com/landonma/Data-Management-Internal-Sharing-Template) repository which contains the template. Open the markdown template in a text editor. Next fill in your own information and delete the instructions. If you want to use Github Pages upload the edited file into your own repository and enable Github Pages.

## FAQ
### Why do I need a Documentation Files?


### Who is this project for?

This Data Management Templates Project is aimed to anyone create and distribute various types of documents. Our templates can be used for any research projects, large and small, of any disciplines.

Whomever is responsible for data management decisions in the project, will probably be the one interested in using this template. In many cases this person will be the Principal Investigator with the help of the research team. In large projects it may be a data manager. A grad student in charge of his/her research project may want to use this too.

We have tried to make this template as general as possible. It is possible that these template will fit some fields more than others. If you have feedback to give us open an issue or send us an e-mail to [ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu](ResearchDataServices@oregonstate.edu), we are very interested in hearing whether this is useful for you!

### Do I need to publish my documents using GitHub?

No, it does not need to be in GitHub. There are a few reasons why we have decided to host these templates GitHub:
- Because you can easily clone our templates, edit them, and have a website with your Data Management Plan Implementation. Having a public Data Management Plan Implementation or other documents in the form of a website will help your research group because it will make your practices transparent, and because everybody in your research group will be able to consult them easily from wherever they are.
- Because it is a tool that many researchers are already familiar with. If you are not one of these researchers, we have created guidelines to help you through the process.
- Because you can edit websites with Markdown. You do not need to know html or other programming languages. Markdown is generally intuitive and easy to learn for most researchers. We have also included a [few guidelines for Markdown editing](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) in this template, just in case.

However, there are many reasons why GitHub may not be the right choice for a research project. This template is also accessible as a Word document, a pdf, and a LaTeX document.
